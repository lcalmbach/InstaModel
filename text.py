    'info': """InstaModel allows you to generate a image recognizing model in just minutes. All you have to do is to define categories of objects you want to recognize in images, search images for each category, then train the model on your images. The App is inspired by the shortcourse [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. The App is built with Streamlit and Fastai. The App is open-source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lcalmbach/InstaModel). this aüü is hosted on the free platform Streamlit Sharing where disk space is limited. The app is therefore intended for getting a feel for building a model and lets you easily try it out. For larger projects, you should consider installing and running the app locally on your machine.""",
